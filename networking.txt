""" Get is usually used as an http request to access a data in a websites
tcp(transport control protocol)built on top of ip(internet protocol)
A socket or network socket is an endpoint of a bidirection inter-process 
communication flow across an internet protocol-based computer network,such as the internet.
A socket is identified by a port number concatenated by a port number.
the server waits for incoming client request by listening to a spefied port.Once a request is 
received,the server accepts a connection from the client socket to complete the connection.
https/http are stateless,unidirectional,half-duplex
websockets are stateful,bidirectional,full-duplex
tcp port numbers // a port is an application-specific or process-specific software communication
endpoint.it allows multiple networked applications to coexist on the same server.
 
 there is a list of well-known tcp port numbers.
 common tcp ports------///
 telnet(23) - login
 ssh(22) - secure login
 http(80)
 https(443) - secure
 smtp(25)(mail)
 imap(143/220/993) - mail retrieval
 pop(109/110) - mail retrieval 
 dns(53) - domain name
 ftp(21) - file transfer
 There are two types of sockets:
 stream socket(sock_stream):used for tcp connections,which provide a reliable,ordered and error-
 checked delivery of data.
 datagram socket(sock_DGRAM):used for udp connections,which provide a 
 connectionless,unreliable service for sending short messages.
 address families such as AF_INET:FOR  ipv4 address:
 AF_INET6: for  ipv6 addreses:
 most websites use utf-8 encoding
 in python 3 all strings are internally unicode/
 when we talk to a network resources using sockets or talk toa  database we have to encode and 
 decode data(usually to utf - 8)
 web scrapping is a program or script to extract information or data from a web pages.
 the tcp/ip gives us pipes/sockets between applications.
 we designed applications protocols to make use of these pipes.
 protocols like http(80) and https(443) are used to gain information between socket n server.
python has good support for sockets , html , and http parsing.

'every node in computer network is identified with the help of ip address'''
''' fault tolerance , scalability , quality of service , security

'''flow of data over a network between two computer or nodes via cable is called data flow'''
'''data can flow in three forms such as simplex , duplex , fullduplex'''
'''[1] in simplex data flow from one node to another via cable such as keyboard to monitor 
where the keyboard sends asks for the data to monitor '''
'''[2] in a halfduplex data flows in both directions but not at the same time.
if one device is sending, the other can nly receive, and vice-versa.
e.g.- walkie-talkie
[3] in fullduplex data flows unidirectional simutaneously at the same time.
e.g. telephone line '''

'''A MAC ADDRESSS SHORT FOR MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL ADDRESS IS A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER ASSIGNED
TO A NETWORK INTERFACE CONTROLLER(NIC) FOR USE IN NETWORK COMMUNICATION.
EACH MAC ADDRESS IS UNIQUE TO THE NETWORK DEVICE IT IS ASSIGNED TO,ENSURING THAT NO TWO 
DEVICES HAVE THE SAME ADDRESS.

A MAC ADDRESS IS TYPICALLY REPRESENTED AS A SERIES OF SIX PAIRS OF HEXADECIMAL DIGITS, 
SEPARATED BY COLONS OR HYPENS (E.G.00:1A:2B:3C:4E:4D)
IT IS USE TO IDENTIFY DEVICES ON A LOCAL NETWORK ,ENABLING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DEVICES
ON THE SAME NETWORK SEGMENT.

SSL - SECURE SOCKET LAYER AND TLS - TRANSPORT LAYER SECURITY ARE CRYPTOGRAPHIC DESINGED TO PROVIDE SECURE COMMUNICATION OVER A COMPUTER NETWORK.
THEY ARE WIDELY USED TO SECURE DATA TRANSMITTED OVER THE INTERNET,SUCH AS IN WEB BROWSING ,EMAIL AND ISNTANT MESSAGING .
WE USE TSL INSTEAD OF SSL FOR DATA SECURITY /.
a socket is defined as an endpoint for communication 
a pair of processes communicatin over a network employee a pair of sockets-one  for each process 
a socket is identified by an ip address concatenated with a port number .
the server waits for incoming client requests by listening to specified port.Once a request is received, the server accepts a 
connection from the client socket to complete the connection.

servers implementing specific services (succh as telnet,ftp,and http) listen to well-known ports
a telnet server listens to port 23 , an ftp server listens to por 21 , and web or http,server listens to port 80
All ports below 1024 are considered well known; we can use them to implement standard services

AF_INET stands for address family -internet 
It is used to specify the type of addresses that your socket can communicate with (in this case ipv4 addresses) 
when you create a socket using AF_INET,it means you're working with ipv4 address 

SOCK_STREAM is used to specify the type of socket.
it indicated that the socket is a stream socket,which means it provides a reliable two-way ,connection based byte stream.
This is TYPICALLY used for tcp(transmission control protocol) connections, which ensure that data is delivered in the 
same order it was sent and without errors.

COMMON ADDRESSS FAMILY ARE :
AF_INET FOR IPV4 ADDRESS 
AF_INET6 FOR IPV6 ADDRESS 
AF_UNIX FOR COMMUNICATING WITHIN THE SAME HOST(UNIX DOMAIN SOCKETS).
EXAMPLE SOCKET.SOCKET(SOCKET.AF_UNIX,SOCKET.SOCK_STREAM)

UTF - 8 IS A CHARACTER ENCODING STANDARD THAT IS USED TO REPRESENT TEXT IN COmPUTERS AND OTHER DEVICES.it is one  OF THE 
MOST WIDELY USED ENCODING FORMATS ON THE WEB AND IN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS.
IT USES ONE TO FOUR BYTES TO REPRESENT EACH CHAREACTER.THIS ALLOWS IT TO EFFICIENTLY ENCODE A WIDE RANGE OF CHARACTERS,INCLUDING THOSE FROM 
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES N SYMBOLS SETS.

UTF - 8 IS BACKWARD COMPATIBLE WITH ASCII,MEANING THAT ANY VALID ASCII TEXT IS ALSO VALID UTF-8 TEXT.
IT IS USED IN VARIOUS APPLICATION ,INCLUDING WEB PAGES,EMAIL,AND FILE STORAGE.most websites use utf-8 encoding to ensure 
that text is displayed correctly across different browsers and devices.

WEB SCRAPPING IS A PROGRAM OR SCRIPT PRETENDS TO BE A BROWSER AND RETIREVES WEB PAGES, LOOKS AT THOSE WEB PAGES, 
EXTREACTS INFORMATION , AND THEN LOOKS AT MORE WEB PAGES/
SCRAPPING IS USED TO PULL DATA PARTICULARLY SOCIAL DATA WHO LINKS TO WHO .
TO GET YOUR OWN DATA BACK OUT OF SOME SYSTEM THAT HAS NO EXPOT CAPABILITY.
TO MONITOR A SITE FOR NEW INFORMATION 
TO SPIDER THE WEB TO MAKE A DATABASE FOR A SEARCH ENGINE

web_crawler is a computer program that browses the world wide web in a methodical, automated manner.Web crawlers are mainly used to 
create a copy of all the visited pages for later processing by a search engine that wil index the downloades pages to provide fast searches.

                            A selection policy  that states which pages to download,
                            A re-visit policy that states when to check for changes to the pages,
                            A politeness policy that states how to avoid overloading web sites,and 
                            A prallelization policy that states how to coordinate distributed web

                            SEARCH ENGINE INDEXING COLLECTS, PARSES AND STORES DATA TO FACILITATE FAST AND ACCURATE
                            INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.THE PURPPOSE OF STORING AN INDEX IS TO OPTIMIZE SPEED AND 
                            PERFORMANCE 
                            IN FINDING RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FOR A SEARCH QUERY.WITHOUT AN INDEX,THE SEARCH ENGINE WOULD SCRAPPINGEVERY DOCUMENT
                            IN THE CORPUS,WHICH WOULD REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE TIME AND COMPUTING POWER.


                          NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATION 
       
       THE FIELF OF NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATION INCLUDES THE ANALYSIS ,DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION AND USE OF LOCAL,
       WIDE AREA AND MOBILE NETWORKS THAT LINK COMPUTERS TOGETHER. THE INTERNET ITSELF IS A NETWORK THAT MAKES IT 
       FEASIBLE FOR NERALY ALL COMPUTERS IN TH WORLD TO COMMUNICATE.
       
       A COMPUTER NETWORK LINKS COMPUTERS TOGETHER VIA A COMBINATIN OF INFRARED LIGHT SIGNALS,RADIO WAVE TRANSMISSIONS,
       TELEPHONE LINE,TELEVISION CABLES AND SATELLITE LINKS. THE CHALLENGE FOR COMPUTER SCIENTISTS HAS 
       BEEN TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS (STANDARDIZED RULES FOR THE FORMAT AND EXCHANGE OF MESSAGES )THAT ALLOW 
       PROCESSES RUNNING ON HOST COMPUTERS TO INTERPRET THE SIGNALS THEY RECEIVE AND TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL 
       CONVERSATIONS IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH TASKS ON BEHALF OF USERS. NETWORK PROTOCOLS ALSO INCLUDE 
       FLOW CONTROL, WHICH KEEPS A DATA SENDER FROM SWAMPING A RECEIVER  WITH MESSAGES THAT IT HAS NO TIME TO 
       PROCESS OR SPACE TO STORE, AND ERROR CONTRO, WHICH INVOLVES TRANSMISSION ERROR DETECTION AND 
       AUTOMATIC RESENDING OF MESSAGES TO CORRECT SUCH ERRORS.
