# Set is the collection of the unordered items. 
# Each element in the set must be unique and its mutable.set doesnot allow duplicate item.
# we can remove,add,update its elements.
# discard() and remove() are two methods to remove element in a set data structure.
# we can remove all element from set data structure using clear() 
# we can also check for membership using "in" keyword in set data structure to find specific data.
# FROZEN SET IS AN  IMMUTABLE VERSION OF SET.
# FORZEN SET ARE HASHABLE THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY ARE IMMUTABLE .tHIS MEANS YOU CAN USE FROZENSETS AS ELEMENTES IN 
# OTHER SETS OR AS KEYS IN DICTIONARIES.

# collection = {'1',"tom",'2','3','4',"hacker","hacker",'6'}
# sorted_collection = sorted(frozenset(collection))
# print(sorted_collection)
# k = frozenset(collection) 
# print(k)

k = 'a' 
length = len(k) 
print(length)
