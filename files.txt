THE SHUTIL MODULE IN PYTHON PROVIDES A HIGHER-LEVEL INTERFACE FOR FILE OPERATIONS COMPARED TO THE OS MODULE.
IT INCLUDES FUNCTIONS FOR COPYIGN ,MOVING AND REMOVING FILES AND DIRECTORIES AMONG OTHER TAKS.
WHILE SHUTIL IS NOT A PART OF THE OS MODULE,IT COMPLEMENTS IT BY OFFERING MORE ADVANCED FILE OPERATIONS.
THE SHUTIL MODULE IS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR PERFORMING HIGH-LEVEL FILE OPERATIONS IN PYTHON.IT IS SEPERATE
FROM THE OS MODULE BUT OFTEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH IT TO HANDLE MORE COMPLEX FILE AND DIRECTORY MANIPULATIONS.

FUNCTIONS OF SHUTIL MODULE :
COPYING  FILE AND DIRECOTRIES --- SHUTIL.COPY(SRC,DST):COPIES A FILE FROM (SRC TO DST).
SHUTIL.COPYTREE(SRC,DST):RECURSIVELY COPIES AN ENTIRE DIRECTORY TREE FROM SRC TO DST.

MOVE FILES AND DIRECTORIES:
SHUTIL.RMTREE(PATH):MOVES A FILES OR DIRECTORY FROM SRC TO DST.

ARCHIVING :
SHUTIL.MAKE_ARCHIVE(BASE_NAME,FORMAT,ROOT_DIR):CREATES AND ARCHIVE FILE (E.G.,ZIP OR TAR) FROM A DIRECTORY.
