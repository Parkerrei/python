# Python Playground 🐍

Welcome to my Python repository! This is a personal space where I explore core Python concepts, scripts, and project ideas as I learn and experiment with new features.

## What's Inside
- 🔁 Practice scripts with loops, conditionals, and functions
- 📁 Organized folders for individual projects or learning topics
- 🧪 Test files and mini experiments in core Python
- 💡 Notes and inline comments for future reference

## Why This Repo?
This repo acts as my learning lab—where I break things on purpose, try out new ideas, and keep a record of what works and what doesn’t in Python development.

## How to Use
Clone the repo and poke around! Feel free to explore each file as a standalone script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parkerrei/python.git
cd python
